**Défi : Santé et Territoires** 🏥
This repository is part of **Season 4 of the Open Data University (ODU)**, an initiative by [Latitudes](https://www.latitudes.cc/) to foster responsible and impactful uses of open data in higher education.

As a volunteer *référent défi*, my role is to explore datasets, create resources, and support students and teachers working on the **"Santé et Territoires" challenge**. The focus is on healthcare access, social determinants of health, and identifying territorial vulnerabilities in France.

👉 All project deliverables and documentation will be in **French**.
